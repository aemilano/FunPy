# Percolation Simulation Table Generator

Percolation is the process of liquid passing through a filter.
This program generates a grid which can simulate this process.

## How does it work?

Program generates a grid filled with random numbers and spaces.
If a column has a empty space within it, it's considered that
percolation is not possible within that column.

If percolation isn't possible within a specific column, it is checked for and marked
within the last row of the grid. A `OK` output where percolation is possible and a
`NO` output where it isn't.

## Features

 User can insert the amount of rows/columns the grid may have to get the grid they want.
 This can be done by running the program within a terminal application and inserting,
 the row/column values as console arguments.

 *Example Argument:*
 `perc.py 3x4` where `3` is the number of rows and `4` is the number of columns.

 Program can be run without console arguments to generate a `5x5` grid.
 Program can write the output to a Text file as well as an HTML file both.

## Limitations

 The program will create grids where the minimum number of rows/columns is 3 and
 the maximum number is 9.

## Requirements

 Program requires `PrettyTable` module to be available within the users system,
 else, it will have limited functionality.
 You can download this module by using `pip`

 Run:

 `pip install prettytable` within the terminal of your choice.

 Python must be added to the system's PATH for both the module and the program to work.

 Program must be run with `perc.py`, `main.py` must be present at the same directory as `perc.py.`
