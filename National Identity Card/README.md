# National Identity Card Parser

A program which can parse through a Sri Lankan Identity Card,
and get various information about the card holder.

## How does it Work?

### Old Version

Old NICs have 9 digits and a character.

   1. First 2 digits tell the birth year of the card holder.
   2. Next three digits tell the gender. (Male if less than 500, Else female.)
   3. Birth month and day can also be discovered through the same three numbers.
   4. Last character tells whether the holder is a voter or not (V for Voters, X if not).

### New Version

New NICs have 12 digits in total.

   1. First 4 digits tell the birth year of the holder.
   2. Next three digits tell the gender (Same as the old version).
   3. Same three numbers would be able to tell the birth month and day.
