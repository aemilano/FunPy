# Encryptor

Encrypt any cleartext files using Python

## Usage

### Encryption

`-e` flag can be used to encrypt any program, followed by the Text(`txt`) file
to be encrypted and, a name plus extension for the output file.

Example : `encrypt.py -e ClearText.txt Output.txt`

A __Key__ Value can be passed in to the program as a console argument.

This key is required to decrypt the created encrypted text file. 

This way,an extra layer of protection can be added.

### Decryption

Just like in Encryption, `-d` flag can be passed as the first console argument.

Followed by the encrypted text file and then an output file name plus the extension.

Example : `encrypt.py -d Output.txt Decoded.txt`

A key can be passed in as the final console argument, if a was used in the encryption
Process. In a case of a wrong key or if the file was decrypted without the Key.
The decoded file will show a corrupted output.

Example : `encrypt.py -d Output.txt Decoded.txt 1234`
